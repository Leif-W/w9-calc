Calc is open source. Contributions of code are welcome.

We welcome and encourage you to send us:

    * calc resource files (cal/*.cal files)
    * calc shell scripts (cscript/*.calc files)
    * builtin functions that you have modified or written, i.e.:
	assocfunc.c comfunc.c func.c func.h
	listfunc.c matfunc.c qfunc.c zfunc.c
    * custom functions that you have modified or written
    * help files modified or written (help/*)
    * Makefile improvements (Makefile, */Makefile)
    * other source code modifications (*.c, *.h)
    * etc. (* */* :) )

In order to consider integrating your code, we need:

    * calc version you are working with (please try use the latest version)
    * new help files or help file patches, if applicable (documentation)
    * proposed text for the CHANGES file (brief description of what it does)
    * regress.cal test patch as needed
    * your source code and/or source code changes (:-))

If you add functionality to calc, please be sure to modify/patch/add
Makefiles, help files, cal/regress.cal test code as well.
Regression test cases are vital to maintaining calc's level
of correctness and helps us avoid code bug regression.

Please try to generate a patch against the most recent
version of calc, and if you use GitHub, the top of the
master branch:

    https://github.com/lcn2/calc

The best way contribute to calc bug is to generate calc
GitHub pull request:
