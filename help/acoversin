NAME
    acoversin - inverse coversed trigonometric sine

SYNOPSIS
    acoversin(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the inverse coversed sine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    The coversed sine function is sometimes called covers, or acosiv, or acvs,
    may be defined as:

	acoversin(x) = asin(1 - x)

EXAMPLE
    ; print acoversin(.5, 1e-5), acoversin(.5, 1e-10), acoversin(.5, 1e-15), acoversin(.5, 1e-20)
    0.5236 0.5235987756 0.523598775598299 0.52359877559829887308

    ; print acoversin(1), acoversin(-5), acoversin(2 + 3i)
    0 1.57079632679489661923-2.47788873028847500481i -0.30760364953071124992-1.86416154415788242834i

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1
