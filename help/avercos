NAME
    avercos - inverse versed trigonometric cosine

SYNOPSIS
    avercos(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the inverse versed trigonometric cosine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    This function is sometimes called averc, or arcvercos, is equivalent to:

	avercos(x) = acos(x - 1)

EXAMPLE
    ; print avercos(.5, 1e-5), avercos(.5, 1e-10), avercos(.5, 1e-15), avercos(.5, 1e-20)
    2.0944 2.0943951024 2.094395102393195 2.09439510239319549231

    ; print avercos(2), avercos(-5), avercos(2 + 3i)
    0 3.14159265358979323846-2.47788873028847500481i 1.26319267726418536931-1.86416154415788242834i

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1
