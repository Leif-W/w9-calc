NAME
    aversin - inverse versed trigonometric sine

SYNOPSIS
    aversin(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the inverse versed sine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    The inverse versed sine function is sometimes called avers, sometimes called aver,
    may be defined as:

	aversin(x) = acos(1 - x)

EXAMPLE
    ; print aversin(.5, 1e-5), aversin(.5, 1e-10), aversin(.5, 1e-15), aversin(.5, 1e-20)
    1.0472 1.0471975512 1.047197551196598 1.04719755119659774615

    ; print aversin(0), aversin(-5), aversin(2 + 3i)
    0 0.16738295495563874081+2.49215996813383545614i 1.87839997632560786916+1.86416154415788242831i

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1
