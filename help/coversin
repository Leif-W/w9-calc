NAME
    coversin - coversed sine

SYNOPSIS
    coversin(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the versed cosine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    The coversed sine function is sometimes called covers, or cosiv, or cvs,
    may be defined as:

	coversin(x) = 1 - sin(x)

EXAMPLE
    ; print coversin(0.2), coversin(3/7), coversin(-31)
    0.80133066920493878454 0.58442814500694799193 0.59596235467693499395

    ; print coversin(1, 1e-5), coversin(1, 1e-10), coversin(1, 1e-15), coversin(1, 1e-20)
    0.15853 0.1585290152 0.158529015192104 0.15852901519210349335

    ; print coversin(2 + 3i, 1e-5), coversin(2 + 3i, 1e-10)
    -8.1545+4.16891i -8.1544991469+4.16890696i

    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print coversin(pi/6, 1e-10), coversin(pi/2, 1e-10), coversin(pi, 1e-10), coversin(3*pi/2, 1e-10)
    0.5 0 1 2

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1
