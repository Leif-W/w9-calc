NAME
    acovercos - inverse coversed trigonometric cosine

SYNOPSIS
    acovercos(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the inverse coversed trigonometric cosine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    This function is sometimes called acvc, or arccovercos, is equivalent to:

	acovercos(x) = asin(x - 1)

EXAMPLE
    ; print acovercos(.5, 1e-5), acovercos(.5, 1e-10), acovercos(.5, 1e-15), acovercos(.5, 1e-20)
    0.5236 0.5235987756 0.523598775598299 0.52359877559829887308

    ; print acovercos(1), acovercos(-5), acovercos(2 + 3i)
    0 -1.57079632679489661923+2.47788873028847500485i 0.30760364953071124992+1.86416154415788242834i

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1
